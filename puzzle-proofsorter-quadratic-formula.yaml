  - Consider $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a \neq 0$.
  - Since $a \neq 0$, we can divide by $a$ to get
    $$x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + \frac{c}{a} = 0.$$
  - We complete the square.
  - This shows that the original equation is equivalent to
    $$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 - \frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a} = 0.$$
  - Since $x$ appears only once in the equation, we can rearrange this
    to solve for $x$.
  - 'Get the squared term on one side of the equation:
    $$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}.$$'
  - 'We can rewrite the right-hand side by putting it over a common denominator:
    $$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}.$$'
  - We can take the square root of both sides.
  - Taking account of the possibility of positive and negative square roots, we see
    $$x + \frac{b}{2a} = \frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
  - Subtracting $\frac{b}{2a}$ from both sides and putting the right-hand side over a common denominator gives
    $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
