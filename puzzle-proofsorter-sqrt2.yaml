  - Suppose, for a contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.
  - That is, we can write $\sqrt{2} = \frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$
    are integers and where $n \neq 0$.
  - Squaring, we have $2 = \frac{m^2}{n^2}$.
  - Multiply across to get $2n^2 = m^2$.
  - In the prime factorisations of $m^2$ and $n^2$, $2$ occurs to an
    even power.
  - In the prime factorisation of $2n^2$, $2$ occurs to an odd power.
  - But prime factorisations are unique, so $2$ should appear to the
    same power in both $2n^2$ and $m^2$.
  - This is a contradiction, so our original assumption that
    $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be wrong.
  - So $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
