## Jigsaw software for CMEP

This software is designed to create Tarsia Formulator type
mathematical jigsaws.  It is currently a work in progress, with the
aim being to have the puzzle in a YAML file, and the software to turn
it into a printable jigsaw.  In this way, it will be easy to create
multiple jigsaw-style puzzles with ease
