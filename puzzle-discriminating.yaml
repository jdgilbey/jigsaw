cards:
  - If $a < 0$, then the equation has no real roots.
  - If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, then the equation has one repeated real root.
  - If the equation has no real roots, then the equation $ax^2 + bx - c = 0$ has two distinct real roots.
  - If $\frac{b^2}{a} < 4c$, then the equation has two distinct real roots.
  - If $b = 0$, then the equation has one repeated real root.
  - The equation has three real roots.
  - If $c = 0$, then the equation has no real roots.
  - The equation has the same number of real roots as $ax^2 - bx + c = 0$.
  - If the equation has two distinct real roots, then $ac < \frac{b^2}{4}$.
  - If $c > 0$, then the equation has two distinct real roots.
  - The equation has the same number of real roots as the equation $cx^2 + bx + a = 0$.
  - If the equation has no real roots, then the equation $-ax^2 - bx - c = 0$ has two distinct real roots.
