AUTHORS for jigsaw
==================

This software was written by Julian Gilbey <jdg@debian.org>.  It is
inspired by the Windows software Tarsia Formulator, and was initially
written to create jigsaw puzzles and card sort activities for
Underground Mathematics (https://undergroundmathematics.org/).

Though it is no longer directly used for that site (as the ideas have
been incorporated directly into the site's software), it remains
useful as a standalone tool for those who wish to use it.
