AUTHORS for jigsaw
==================

This software was written by Julian Gilbey <J.Gilbey@maths.cam.ac.uk>,
<jdg@debian.org>.  It is inspired by the Windows software Tarsia
Formulator, and was written to create jigsaw puzzles and card sort
activities for Underground Mathematics, formerly known as the
Cambridge Mathematics Education Project.

It is no longer used by the project, as software based on this has now
been incorporated into the site, but this remains as a useful
by-product.
